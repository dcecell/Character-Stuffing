# Character-Stuffing
PROGRAM TO DEMONSTRATE CHARACTER COUNT/STUFFING FRAMING TECHNIQUE

# Objective : 
 Objective of this program is to study and to practically implement character count/Stuffing  framming method. 

# Outcome : 
 After implementing this program student will be able to   demonstrate the character count technique.

Student will be able to add character count long stream of data for transmission and can retrieve the original data by counting the redundant bits count 

# Implementation Details : -

 Student is required to write a sender program where sender will take actual data to be transmitted as input from user and store it in buffer.

 - Now character count is added at the begining of every frame. (You can also display the codeword)
 - Write a receiver program where it accepts the codeword sent from sender end. (You can also display the accepted codeword from sender)

 - Now check count and bits from the codeword and retrieve the actual data. Now display the actual data
